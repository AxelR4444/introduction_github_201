        <p>I've been tryin' to make you love me But everything 
           I try just takes you further from me</p>
        <p>Someday, we gon' set it off
            Someday, we gon' get this off
            Baby, don't you bet it all
            On a pack of fentanyl
            You might think they wrote you off</p>
